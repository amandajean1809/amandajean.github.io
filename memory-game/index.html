      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Once the players enter their names, the player that starts is picked randomly. That player will start selecting the cards on the screen in pairs. If the images on the back of the cards match, a point is earned and the player's turn continues as long as the pair selections match. At that point the second player will begin picking card pairs until a mis-match occurrs. Once the cards are all turned over the player with the most matches wins the game.
